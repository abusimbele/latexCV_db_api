latexCV_db_api
==============

Write your Curriculum vitae(CV) with latex filled with your data from xing or linkedin (API usage)

We will use Vagrant for better development in terms of portability, reproducibility and productivity.
For the backend / webservice we will use Ruby & Rails with a gem for OAuth (Authentification for the Xing API) and da DBMS we will rely on (that means, decision will be made later ...).
Our frontend will be ether programmed in python or  ruby & rails.
